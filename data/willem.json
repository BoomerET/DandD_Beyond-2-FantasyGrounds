After a boring day at sea a ship appeared on the horizon. The ship got within arrow range and three angry female Elves unleashed a barrage of arrow aimed suspiciously at the messenger. You fought back well and the ship retreated but your NPC companion was seriously injured. Your Cleric saved your NPC and he passed out in his cabin. The next day you arrived at Baldur's Gate and your NPC friend was up and about ready to conduct business at the dock.</p>\n<p>After a brief disagreement about what to do you walked along the wall and arrived at the main gate where you met Captain Zodge. Captain Zodge told you that Hermer keeps sending him help and the help disappears into the city never to be seen again. Captain Zodge sent you to a tavern to meet a spy with some information and drafted you into the Flaming Fist. Your mission is to find the Dead of Three hide out and eliminate all of the cultist. You&nbsp; negotiated a deal to help the Elf spy in exchange for information and a favor that she will owe you. Trouble found you at the bar and you got the drop on the same pirates that attacked you when you were out to sea. As your attackers stumbled about and half of them fell to the ground before the fight even started you finished them off in less than 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>You split up some minor loot and found out that you will be going to take a bath and maybe find a dungeon.</p>","dmUserId":101044138,"dmUsername":"j4d2007","characters":[{"userId":101665402,"username":"Diode","characterId":18742598,"characterName":"Arken","characterUrl":"/profile/Diode/characters/18742598","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/10/89/150/150/636339382189764523.png","privacyType":3},{"userId":101401913,"username":"SVincent","characterId":23050611,"characterName":"ShoJin Killsword","characterUrl":"/profile/SVincent/characters/23050611","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8795/486/150/150/637175646492793638.png","privacyType":3},{"userId":101509360,"username":"roninkelt","characterId":23254719,"characterName":"Xyrseris","characterUrl":"/profile/roninkelt/characters/23254719","avatarUrl":"","privacyType":3},{"userId":106531677,"username":"Shakamojo","characterId":23503240,"characterName":"Vinster","characterUrl":"/profile/Shakamojo/characters/23503240","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/10303/473/150/210/1581111423-23503240.jpeg","privacyType":3},{"userId":107346054,"username":"Sturm2k","characterId":27203070,"characterName":"Willem","characterUrl":"/profile/Sturm2k/characters/27203070","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/12775/410/151/150/1581111423-27203070.jpeg","privacyType":3}]},"creatures":[],"vehicles":[],"components":[]}
