She cast me into the sea of moving ice when I was ten years old as a sacrifice to Auril the Frostmaiden. I had nothing but a small pendant that my father had given me. A polar bear pulled me from the water and saved me from a certain death. The bear transformed into a goliath and brought me to Lonelywood. I remember the goliaths name, Oyaminartok, but I have not seen her since that day. I owe my mother a merciless death and I own Oyaminartok my life.\n\nThe polar bear left me in the care of a halfling hunter who raised me in the woods near Lonelywood. He taught me the art of hunting and fishing. I soon got so good at hunting my new father suggest that I shoot at fish along the shore to improve my accuracy. \n\nMy adopted fathers home was attacked by Orcs a few years before I came of age. My father was killed in the fight and our home was burned. I went with the townsfolk to find the Orc war party. Using my fathers lessons I stalked the war party with a small group of townsfolk and got my revenge. \n\n\nI returned to Lonleywood and I moved into a small inn and took a job supplying game and fish to the inn in exchange for a room. A few weeks after my coming of age I arrived at my inn/home to find it ablaze. A crowd had gathered to prevent the fire from moving to other buildings. Someone yelled out that a halfling family was trapped inside the inn. I ran upstairs not to save the family but to gather my few possessions. \n\nThe stairs had collapsed before I could get back downstairs and I realized the quickly that the only exit was through a window so I grabbed the father and threw him feet first through the window and he slid down the roof perfectly like it was my plan all along. Then I threw the children and wife out the window. I wasn't very gentle but they didn't notice, I decided to help myself to a few gold pieces on the dresser and realized an infant was in a drawer. I gently grabbed the infant and bundled her up. \n\nFlames were all over the room so I jumped out the window and slid down the roof coming to a stop at the feet of the towns elders. The entire town had gathered around the fire and witnessed my heroics and believed that I ran into the burning inn to save the family. I became the towns hero.\n\nI'm well know in the town and slightly known in neighboring communities. Halflings know me really well because I have a special place in my heart for halflings. I often leave small game at the door step of a needy family but I refuse payment or even a thank you. \n\nAfter a year of helping the family recover and earning a living as a hunter in Lonleywood I grow weary of the small amount of local fame I have and decide to seek out the Polar Bear and my mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","otherNotes":null},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"I judge people by their actions, not their words.\nI’m confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.","ideals":"Freedom.
