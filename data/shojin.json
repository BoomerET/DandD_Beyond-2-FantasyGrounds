To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Emissary</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Pilgrim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Exile</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Sightseer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Fugitive</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Wanderer</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Where Are You From?</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd people.<br></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;Suggested Characteristics&nbsp;</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:\n\nDrain Life. You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.\n\nQuery. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\nFreeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\n\nA soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine’s furnace (see \"Soul Fuel\").\n\nFreeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\n\nHellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.","weight":null,"cost":null,"quantity":1,"notes":null}],"campaign":{"id":870977,"name":"Baldur's Gate","description":"<p>Welcome to the town of Baldur's Gate.
