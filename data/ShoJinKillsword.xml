					<p class="compendium-hr">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the Weapons section.</p>

					<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="List-Styles_List-Item-Centered"><strong>Ki save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Flurry of Blows</h5>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Step of the Wind</h5>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>

					<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><strong>Kensei Weapons.</strong> Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon - either melee or ranged - to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><strong>Agile Parry.</strong> If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><strong>Kensei's Shot.</strong> You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><strong>Way of the Brush.</strong> You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies.</p>

As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
<p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>

					<p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>
<p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>
<p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
<p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <strong>bag of holding</strong>, <strong>portable hole</strong>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

 	<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>
 	<p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
 	<p><b>Ki save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
 	<p><b>Flurry of Blows</b></p>
 	<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>
 	<p><b>Patient Defense</b></p>
 	<p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
 	<p><b>Step of the Wind</b></p>
 	<p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>

Xyrseris - Goliath, Scarred (7 1/2" Feet, Barbarian Druid (Bear)
  Terrible Temper\nPersonalPossessions: Tunning fork (may come in handy in a place called Knucklebone)\nOrganizations: Zhentarim\nEnemies: Gideon - Found him while while trying to recover the city in Hell.  He took part in the raid on my monastery.  I defeated him, tied him up and interrogated him and led me to this next up the chain.  His master is Raz Dhul.



Raz Dhul - In Waterdeep, acting as a priest of Helm\nBackstory: Temple of Infinity, Master Ra-Thran



An orphan from another land. My fellow acolytes were my adopted brothers and sisters, the old head my order like a father, though a very stern morally flexible one. I was devoted to my studies and worked hard to become the weapon that I am. From my training, I do not see the world as good or evil, and my actions are always in the service of my code and what I see as the path or right. 

It was only after years that I discovered the truth of the what drove my master, and how his past haunted him. One day that past came back to haunt him when our monestary was attacked by his old enemy of his from Faerun. After a huge battle where I killed many the enemies warriors, I escaped into the night. I had on the clothes on my back, the sword of my master, a small statue that is the symbol of my order. and a patch of cloth from uniform of one of the warriors.

I travel far to the town of Waterdeep, the town my Master left years ago, looking for clues that could lead me to the villain who killed my Master so I can take my revenge.

I made contact with a man named Hermer, who my Master had once mentioned.  The revenge business has so far lead me nowhere, so I work for him for now on this task that takes me to Baldur's gate.\nOtherNotes: Captain Zodge
