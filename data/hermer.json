These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures.

Now you're in for it. You're locked in cells, deep beneath the streets of Waterdeep, and Thor knows what fate awaits you.&nbsp; Well, know you have plenty of time to think about how you got in this mess and what you could do get yourself out.&nbsp; Zounds... it was just... what... about two hours ago you were dining with the Open Lord of Waterdeep, making plans to help foil Xanathar and Guild and keep him from getting his ... well do beholders HAVE hands?... appendages?... anyway... access to the gold. She even gave you a gift, the last item you required to open the door to the chamber (thankfully, you've kept that hidden). Of course the rest of the items could be found if someone had the time and the inclination... and knew what they were looking for.&nbsp; Xanathar's henchmen certainly have the time since you're locked up here. Ah well, at least you'll have some time to rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>07/30 - Yeah... it's been a while.&nbsp; </strong>So you cleaned up and went back to the Tavern.&nbsp; After leaving Willem and Hermer in bed recovering, the rest of you, including your new friend Torrun headed back to the Temple of Gond for help in locating the Nimblewright.&nbsp; That creature being the only clue you have. Lot's of theories abound regarding what is actually going on. You know the dwarf, Dalakhar’s&nbsp; was on his way to see you when he was blown up.&nbsp; You heard from Renaer think's Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">Stone of Golorr</span> to his father in Neverwinter.&nbsp; You know Urstul Floxin, grabbed the <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">Stone of Golorr</span> from Dalakhar's smoking corpse and went straight to Gralhund Villa, in the North Ward. You also know the nimblewright detector lead you as well to the villa. Somehow all three are tied up with the stone.</p>\n<p>You decided to go back and start searching for the nimblewright near the villa. You found it, hiding in the sewers nearby. It immediately attacked, leaving you no choice but to fight back, eventually destroying it. While collecting it's parts for the 500dragon reward, you did find a hand drawn map (nice paper, good quality ink and penmanship) leading you to a tenement in the Dockward, and crazy old treasure hunter named Grinda Garloth.&nbsp; When you reached her house you found it was under attack by Bandits, lead by evil looking Dwarf.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10/30 -&nbsp;</strong>Took possession of Trollskull Tavern.&nbsp; Might be haunted... some things moving on their own.&nbsp; Met the neighbors... smiths, herbalist, book store, and others.&nbsp; Nice neighborhood... all are excited about having the Tavern open again.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few other groups are excited about having the Adventurers around and have started to get in contact.&nbsp; Harpers, Force Gray, and the Zhentarim have all made contact.&nbsp; Zhents gave them a mission to help out searching for a murder suspect in the Dock Ward. The found and attacked a Drow who was going after a drunken sailor... don't know why... but they seem to have solved that problem.</p>\n<p><strong>10/25 -</strong> Shortly after the battle with the Kenku and rescuing Reanar, the City Watch arrived.&nbsp;Captain Staget, an extremely uptight Watch commander wasn't suprised at the violence in this seedy Dock Ward warehouse, but was on his best behanvior in the presence of two nobles.&nbsp; The group was questioned and released. While some of the group searched for clues as to where Floon was taken, Helmer called in a Cleric/Bounty Hunter acquaintance of his to assist the group. Soon enough they were down in the sewers, following chalk marks matching the Xanathar symbol they had seen before.&nbsp; They briefly found with a what seemed like a small beholder, defeating it easily, and found an underground hideout...&nbsp; All the clues pointed here, so they entered.&nbsp; Subduing guards, avoiding ooze, fighting evil dwarves... lead them to a large chamber where they saw Floon, being tortured by an Orc Wizard and over seen by a Mindflayer.&nbsp; A battle ensued... Helmer being set on fire, Bane loosing his mind (literally... 0 Intelligence) and other assorted injuries. Eventually, both the Flayer and Wizard escaped, Floon was rescued and the brain with feet was squashed.&nbsp; Eventually all made it back to the Yawning Portal where Volo welcomed them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was short on Cash but did have the deed to a Mansion he could get them.. and he would even cover the transfer fees.</p>\n<p>Now the question is... What will the group do with the Mansion?</p>\n<p><strong>10/16 -</strong> Met up in Yawning Portal, fought some thugs, a Troll.&nbsp; Met Volo, got tasked to find Floon, fought Xanathar goons (Kenku) and found Reanar instead. Just as you were getting to know each other, the City watch arrived.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","dmUserId":101401913,"dmUsername":"dadgonzo77","characters":[{"userId":101044138,"username":"j4d2007","characterId":5895274,"characterName":"Hermer Selevarun","characterUrl":"/profile/j4d2007/characters/5895274","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/17/221/150/150/636377842071269252.jpeg","privacyType":3},{"userId":101665402,"username":"Diode","characterId":14564611,"characterName":"Torrun Stormbeard","characterUrl":"/profile/Diode/characters/14564611","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/17/988/150/150/636378944641601219.jpeg","privacyType":3},{"userId":106531677,"username":"Shakamojo","characterId":21452036,"characterName":"Stobor Ibonek","characterUrl":"/profile/Shakamojo/characters/21452036","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8345/561/162/150/637144534267971278.png","privacyType":3}]},"creatures":[],"vehicles":[],"components":[]}
