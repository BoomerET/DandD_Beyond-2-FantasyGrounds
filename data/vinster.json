They have all been pulling small time jobs and guard duty/body guard work for an underboss in the Zhentarium named Inigo and his enforcer the Giant Fezzik. Inigo sends you to meet a mysterious up and comer in the organization named Hermer Selevarun. Hermer is an Elf who you know is important but you don't really know what he does. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial black, sans-serif; font-size: 14px\"><span style=\"text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; display: inline !important; float: none\">ShoJin comes from beyond the border forest.

Some of his co-owners live in the building and mostly stay out of the way and go about their business. In the meeting you meet ShoJin and Arken who are non-Zhents, Hermer tells you that they will be joining you on a mission of importance to Waterdeep and the Zhentarium.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial black, sans-serif; font-size: 14px\"><span style=\"text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; display: inline !important; float: none\">Your band finds out that Hermer is working for a splinter group of the Zhents called the Koshka Brotherhood. He tells you Brotherhood controls a vast spy and trading network along the Sword Coast. The Brotherhood passes some information and sometimes \"acquired\" goods to various buyers along the Sword Coast. Hermer tells you the Brotherhood has granted you membership and is sending you on a small errand. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial black, sans-serif; font-size: 14px\"><span style=\"text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; display: inline !important; float: none\">Hermer promises those of you in the Zhents the opportunity to leave the group without paying a \"tax\" to the Zhents and a large reward. For ShoJin your debt is payed and Hermer promises to give you what he knows you want. For Arken he offers you a large scroll, he cuts it in half and gives you the bottom and promises you the top half when you return. Your mission for the the brotherhood is to escort <span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-family: arial black, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none\">\"the messenger,\" a Halfling who's a bit portly and out of shape, to Baldur's gate.

Typical of Hermer he neglects to tell you the wine has not been taxed by the government in Waterdeep so you should leave immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>3/18/2020</p>\n<p>Our fearless adventurers departed Waterdeep and sailed down the Sword Coast. After a boring day at sea a ship appeared on the horizon. The ship got within arrow range and three angry female Elves unleashed a barrage of arrow aimed suspiciously at the messenger. You fought back well and the ship retreated but your NPC companion was seriously injured. Your Cleric saved your NPC and he passed out in his cabin. The next day you arrived at Baldur's Gate and your NPC friend was up and about ready to conduct business at the dock.</p>\n<p>After a brief disagreement about what to do you walked along the wall and arrived at the main gate where you met Captain Zodge. Captain Zodge told you that Hermer keeps sending him help and the help disappears into the city never to be seen again. Captain Zodge sent you to a tavern to meet a spy with some information and drafted you into the Flaming Fist. Your mission is to find the Dead of Three hide out and eliminate all of the cultist. You&nbsp; negotiated a deal to help the Elf spy in exchange for information and a favor that she will owe you. Trouble found you at the bar and you got the drop on the same pirates that attacked you when you were out to sea. As your attackers stumbled about and half of them fell to the ground before the fight even started you finished them off in less than 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>You split up some minor loot and found out that you will be going to take a bath and maybe find a dungeon.</p>","dmUserId":101044138,"dmUsername":"j4d2007","characters":[{"userId":101665402,"username":"Diode","characterId":18742598,"characterName":"Arken","characterUrl":"/profile/Diode/characters/18742598","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/10/89/150/150/636339382189764523.png","privacyType":3},{"userId":101401913,"username":"SVincent","characterId":23050611,"characterName":"ShoJin Killsword","characterUrl":"/profile/SVincent/characters/23050611","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8795/486/150/150/637175646492793638.png","privacyType":3},{"userId":101509360,"username":"roninkelt","characterId":23254719,"characterName":"Xyrseris","characterUrl":"/profile/roninkelt/characters/23254719","avatarUrl":"","privacyType":3},{"userId":106531677,"username":"Shakamojo","characterId":23503240,"characterName":"Vinster","characterUrl":"/profile/Shakamojo/characters/23503240","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/10303/473/150/210/1581111423-23503240.jpeg","privacyType":3},{"userId":107346054,"username":"Sturm2k","characterId":27203070,"characterName":"Willem","characterUrl":"/profile/Sturm2k/characters/27203070","avatarUrl":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/12775/410/151/150/1581111423-27203070.jpeg","privacyType":3}]},"creatures":[],"vehicles":[],"components":[]}
